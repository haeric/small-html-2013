Small HTML 2013
==============
My entry for the [Small HTML compo](http://www.gathering.org/tg13/no/creative/competition-rules/small-html/) 
at The Gathering 2013. The task was to recreate 
[this effect](http://www.gathering.org/tg13/files/content/creativia/small.html) using as few bytes as possible.
The colors did not have to be exactly the same though, and it didn't have to spin at the same pace: 
This fact was used to shave off a few more bytes :)

[Have a look at it!](http://haeric.github.com/small-html-2013/entry_minified.html) (253 bytes)
